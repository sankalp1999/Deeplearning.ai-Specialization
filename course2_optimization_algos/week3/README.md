This was a fairly easy assignment. The making of the static computation graph was something new for me as I had prior experience in Pytorch only.
In this assignment, one interesting thing happened. 

### Initialized bias vector with Xavier initialization gave more accuracy (accident?)
I had by mistake initialized the bias vector with Xavier initialization. I got more accuracy with that.
Later, I corrected that to get full points.
