# [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

Quoting Andrew Ng,
> "Artificial Intelligence is the new electricity."
   
This repository contains my notes and some important references of resources I used. I learnt a lot of new concepts in the course and I enjoyed making these notes. The CNN course is my favourite. Apart from that, I feel if anyone is not doing the whole specialization, he/she should atleast do the 
first 2 courses to get a deeper understanding of the NN and optimization algorithms. 

You can find my notes via links below or by navigating through the repo.

### About the specialization from the course page

If you want to break into AI, this Specialization will help you do so. Deep Learning is one of the most highly sought after skills in tech. We will help you become good at Deep Learning.

In five courses, you will learn the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects. You will learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. You will work on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. You will master not only the theory, but also see how it is applied in industry. You will practice all these ideas in Python and in TensorFlow, which we will teach.

You will also hear from many top leaders in Deep Learning, who will share with you their personal stories and give you career advice.

AI is transforming multiple industries. After finishing this specialization, you will likely find creative ways to apply it to your work.

We will help you master Deep Learning, understand how to apply it, and build a career in AI.

### My experience
This course is great for a deep theoretical understanding. I enjoyed it a lot so far. Currently, doing course 4. 
I had prior deeplearning experience (using Pytorch) but I had many gaps in knowledge. This specialization has helped a lot
to bridge those gaps.

Andrew Ng sir does an excellent job at explaining the intricacies and intuitions involved. He also makes sure that 
we know about the "nitty-gritty" details.

If you want to get a good grasp on the foundations of deep learning, this is probably the best way to go.

**I have made a significant amount of effort to make digital notes for the courses 2, (3, 4 and 5 in progress). I hope you will enjoy the notes.**

## Notes

I have made notes for some of the courses. I used the following notes also to re-read and understand 
the course material. The ppant notes are more of transcript. I would recommend using the mbadry1 and 
of-course, **check out my notes as I have tried to summarise and integrate resources** .

### Course 2 - Optimization Algorithms and Hyper-parameter tuning

[Course_2](https://github.com/sankalp1999/Deeplearning.ai-specialization/tree/master/course2_optimization_algos)

This [blog](https://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/) by Sebastian Ruder is amazing and it started making sense after the course 2.

Deeplizard channel and CodeEmporium on Youtube.

CS231N(2017 or 2016) versions - the first half is similar to what is taught in the first two courses of this specialization. 

### Course 4 - Convolutional Neural Networks

[Course 4 - CNN](https://github.com/sankalp1999/Deeplearning.ai-Specialization/tree/master/course_4_Convolutional_Neural_Networks) notes.

- CS231N again is the ultimate work on Computer Vision.
- ComputerPhile has a lot of videos on Image Processing. This is still in my to-do list though.
- A hidden gem on Youtube is the recently released playlist by CMU. Check [here](https://youtu.be/XXCfkmaglvY)
- [Henry AI Labs channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHB9VepY6kYvZjj0Bgxnpbw/playlists) on Youtube has many paper explanations.
