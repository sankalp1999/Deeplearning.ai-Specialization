## Geoffrey Hinton Sir

> Read the literature and don't read too much of it. Read a little bit of literature and notice something that somebody is doing something wrong, then rectify that and when people say that is no good, just keep your stay, Either your intuitions are good, or they don't. You should trust your intuition.
Never stop programming. read enough so that you start developing intuition. Others say it's complete nonsense, then you are onto something. New grad students should work: see if you can find an advisor who has beliefs like you.
Right now, there aren't enough academics.

## Ian Goodfellow's advice

> You do not need to get a PhD. One way to get attention is to write good code and put it on GitHub. If you have a project that solves some problem at a top-level, then if they find your GitHub repo, they will come to find you and ask you to come there.Open-source
Writing papers and putting them on archive
A lot of times difficult to be academic cont.                                                       Read book, work on a project. Focus on mathematics fundamentals.

### Learning is accessible

> I think it's a really good time to enter Artificial Intelligence. A lot of it you can self study. 
Check out Andrew's course, Andrey Karpathy's course and Berkeley's Reinforcement learning course is there.

This holds still!!

### Try things yourself and implement more.

> I think a big part of what what's important is to to make sure you try things yourself so not just read things or watch videos but try things out with frameworks like tensorlow ,chainer ,Theano, Pytorch and so forth I mean whatever is your favorite just it's very easy to get going and get something up and running quickly

Andrew summarises it as to get the practice yourself and see what works and what
does not work.

They talk about [anokas](https://www.kaggle.com/anokas) who became a kaggle master in 2016.

**Andrew asks  what should people do? Apply for big companies or apply for a PhD program.**

A lot of is to do with how much mentoring you get, PhD mentor will help you a lot and that is why they are professors. Companies also have good mentors. Not much of a guarantee.
Mentor will help learn faster. He says that one can learn a lot on their own but you learn
much faster under a mentor.
