> Read the literature and don't read too much of it. Read a little bit of literature and notice something that somebody is doing something wrong, then rectify that and when people say that is no good, just keep your stay, Either your intuitions are good, or they don't. You should trust your intuition.
Never stop programming. read enough so that you start developing intuition. Others say it's complete nonsense, then you are onto something. New grad students should work: see if you can find an advisor who has beliefs like you.
Right now, there aren't enough academics.

## Ian Goodfellow's advice

> You do not need to get a PhD. One way to get attention is to write good code and put it on GitHub. If you have a project that solves some problem at a top-level, then if they find your GitHub repo, they will come to find you and ask you to come there.Open-source
Writing papers and putting them on archive
A lot of times difficult to be academic cont.                                                       Read book, work on a project. Focus on mathematics fundamentals.

### Learning is accessible

> I think it's a really good time to enter Artificial Intelligence. A lot of it you can self study. 
Check out Andrew's course, Andrey Karpathy's course and Berkeley's Reinforcement learning course is there.

This holds still!!

### Try things yourself and implement more.

> I think a big part of what what's important is to to make sure you try things yourself so not just read things or watch videos but try things out with frameworks like tensorlow ,chainer ,Theano, Pytorch and so forth I mean whatever is your favorite just it's very easy to get going and get something up and running quickly

Andrew summarises it as to get the practice yourself and see what works and what
does not work.

They talk about [anokas](https://www.kaggle.com/anokas) who became a kaggle master in 2016.

**Andrew asks  what should people do? Apply for big companies or apply for a PhD program.**

A lot of is to do with how much mentoring you get, PhD mentor will help you a lot and that is why they are professors. Companies also have good mentors. Not much of a guarantee.
Mentor will help learn faster. He says that one can learn a lot on their own but you learn
much faster under a mentor.

### Try to get to the low-level and implement yourself
> Yeah absolutely so I think when people talk to me about CS231
  And why they thought it was a very useful course what people what I keep hearing again
  and again is just people appreciate the fact that we got all the way to the low level details and they were not working with a library they saw the
  raw code and they saw how everything was implemented and implemented chunks of it themselves, and so just going all the way down to the
  understanding everything under you and never
  It's really important to not abstract away things like you need to have a full understanding of the whole stack
  And that's where I learned the most myself as well when I was learning this stuff
  It's just implementing it myself from scratch was the most important
  It was the piece that that I felt gave me
  The best kind of a bang for buck in terms of understanding, so I wrote my own library it's called convnet js
  it was written in Javascript and implements convolutional neural networks that was my way of learning about back propagation and
  So that's something that I keep advising people is that that you
  Not work with tensorflow or something else you can work with it once you have written it something
  Something yourself on the lowest detail you understand everything under you and now you are comfortable to you now
  It's possible to use some of these frameworks that abstract some of it away from you
  but you know what's under the hood and
  So that's been something that helped me the most
  That's something that people appreciate the most when they take 231N and that's when I would advise a lot of people
  Rather than you [ ]
  Yeah, yeah, and it's some kind of a sequence of layers, and I know that when I add some drop out layers
  It makes it work better, but that's not what you want in that
 Case you're you're not going to be able to debug effectively you're not going to be able to improve a models effectively
