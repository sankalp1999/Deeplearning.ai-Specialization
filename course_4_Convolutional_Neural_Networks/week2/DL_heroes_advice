Geoffrey Hinton Sir
--> Read the literature and don't read too much of it. Read a little bit of literature and notice something that somebody is doing something wrong, then rectify that and when people say that is no good, just keep your stay, Either your intuitions are good, or they don't. You should trust you intuition.

Andrew Ng : replicate the papers.
Never stop programming. read enough so that you start developing intuition. Other say it's complete non-sense, then you are onto something. 

New grad students should work : see if you can find an advisor who has beliefs like you. 
Right now, there aren't enough academics. 


Ian Goodfellow's advice
You do not need to get a Ph.D. One way to get attention is to write good code and put it on GitHub. If you have a project that solves some problem at a top level, then if they find your github repo, they will come find you and ask you to come there. 

Open-source
Writing papers and putting them on archive
A lot of times difficult to be academic cont., 

Read book, work on a project. Maths

Smart decision in terms of actually getting going.
Andrej Karpathy's course.
Berkeley's deep reinforcement learning course

Most important : Try things yourself. NOt just read or watch videos, with frameworks like PyTorch. To get the practice yourself. He just went out, found things online.

A lot of is to do with how much mentoriing you get, Ph.D mentor will help you a lot and that is why they are professors. Companies also have good mentors. Not much of a guarantee.
Mentor will help learn faster.
